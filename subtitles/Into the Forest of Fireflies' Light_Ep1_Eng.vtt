1
00:00:53.287 --> 00:00:54.667
There we go...

2
00:00:56.287 --> 00:00:59.197
Make sure you listen to your uncle.

3
00:00:59.197 --> 00:01:00.367
Yeah.

4
00:01:00.367 --> 00:01:02.247
Do you have your handkerchief? Your ticket?

5
00:01:02.247 --> 00:01:04.367
A nice pair of shoes?

6
00:01:04.367 --> 00:01:05.787
Wait, don't tell me that's everything?

7
00:01:05.787 --> 00:01:08.047
It's fine. I made sure I packed the black ones.

8
00:01:08.957 --> 00:01:11.677
Make sure you don't forget your luggage on the bullet train, okay?

9
00:01:11.677 --> 00:01:13.807
Don't zone out and miss your stop.

10
00:01:13.807 --> 00:01:15.307
Yeah, I got it!

11
00:01:15.687 --> 00:01:19.157
Jeez. I've been going there every year, so I'll be all right.

12
00:01:19.157 --> 00:01:22.637
Hey, put on a hat. You'll get heat stroke.

13
00:01:22.637 --> 00:01:25.067
It's alright! I'm fine.

14
00:01:27.567 --> 00:01:28.907
See you!

15
00:01:57.137 --> 00:01:59.227
<i>The first time I met him</i>

16
00:02:01.477 --> 00:02:03.567
<i>was when I was six.</i>

17
00:02:04.567 --> 00:02:12.907
To the Forest of Firefly Lights

18
00:02:14.017 --> 00:02:15.957
<i>On a hot summer day,</i>

19
00:02:15.957 --> 00:02:19.267
<i>I got lost in the forest of the mountain god,</i>

20
00:02:19.827 --> 00:02:21.997
<i>which was said to be where spirits lived.</i>

21
00:02:24.867 --> 00:02:27.557
<i>After running around searching for an exit</i>

22
00:02:27.557 --> 00:02:29.627
<i>I became so tired I couldn't move.</i>

23
00:02:30.567 --> 00:02:35.147
<i>When I started crying from fear and loneliness,</i>

24
00:02:35.987 --> 00:02:38.447
<i>he appeared before me.</i>

25
00:02:41.257 --> 00:02:42.807
Hey! Shorty!

26
00:03:02.557 --> 00:03:04.537
Why are you crying?

27
00:03:08.277 --> 00:03:11.667
It's a person! I'm saved!

28
00:03:24.717 --> 00:03:26.187
S-Sorry.

29
00:03:28.157 --> 00:03:31.397
You're a human child, right?

30
00:03:32.587 --> 00:03:35.867
If a human touches me, I'll disappear.

31
00:03:38.187 --> 00:03:40.397
If a human...?

32
00:03:41.077 --> 00:03:43.217
You're not a human?

33
00:03:44.417 --> 00:03:47.177
I'm... something that lives in this forest.

34
00:03:48.897 --> 00:03:51.597
What? Then... you're one of the spirits?

35
00:03:52.747 --> 00:03:56.427
But... what do you mean by disappear?

36
00:04:21.137 --> 00:04:24.447
Y-You're really not human after all...

37
00:04:27.077 --> 00:04:31.577
No human would hit a child like that!

38
00:04:32.977 --> 00:04:37.137
To disappear means to be obliterated.

39
00:04:38.787 --> 00:04:42.797
That's the spell that the mountain god placed upon me.

40
00:04:44.507 --> 00:04:46.447
If I get touched by a human,

41
00:04:47.957 --> 00:04:49.267
that's the end.

42
00:04:52.007 --> 00:04:55.057
I-I'm sorry.

43
00:04:55.057 --> 00:04:56.667
Here, shorty.

44
00:04:57.737 --> 00:04:59.197
Grab the other end.

45
00:05:00.237 --> 00:05:01.347
You're lost, aren't you?

46
00:05:02.767 --> 00:05:04.467
I'll lead you out of the forest.

47
00:05:06.707 --> 00:05:08.327
Thank you!

48
00:05:12.977 --> 00:05:14.037
Didn't I just tell you?

49
00:05:14.037 --> 00:05:17.087
Sorry, I just...

50
00:05:32.007 --> 00:05:34.457
It's just like going on a date!

51
00:05:35.027 --> 00:05:36.997
Not a very romantic one...

52
00:05:44.107 --> 00:05:46.997
You... aren't afraid.

53
00:05:48.837 --> 00:05:49.627
Of what?

54
00:05:50.917 --> 00:05:51.677
Never mind.

55
00:05:55.677 --> 00:05:58.407
If you go straight, you'll hit the mountain path.

56
00:05:59.717 --> 00:06:00.427
Bye.

57
00:06:01.987 --> 00:06:04.247
Are you always going to be here?

58
00:06:05.097 --> 00:06:07.097
If I come back here, can we meet again?

59
00:06:08.197 --> 00:06:10.877
This is the forest where the mountain god and spirits live.

60
00:06:12.387 --> 00:06:14.977
Set foot within, and you'll lose your way and be lost forever.

61
00:06:16.697 --> 00:06:17.947
You shouldn't come here.

62
00:06:18.987 --> 00:06:21.117
That's what the villagers say, right?

63
00:06:25.657 --> 00:06:27.907
I'm Takegawa Hotaru.

64
00:06:28.417 --> 00:06:29.117
You?

65
00:06:49.037 --> 00:06:52.707
Anyway, I'll be back tomorrow with a thank-you present!

66
00:06:52.707 --> 00:06:53.517
Bye!

67
00:06:54.047 --> 00:06:54.647
It's Gin.

68
00:07:13.737 --> 00:07:14.537
Hotaru!

69
00:07:14.537 --> 00:07:16.327
Ah, Uncle!

70
00:07:17.597 --> 00:07:21.017
Hotaru, you idiot!

71
00:07:21.547 --> 00:07:24.857
If you go into the forest on your own and get hurt, what are you gonna do?

72
00:07:37.727 --> 00:07:38.647
Uncle.

73
00:07:38.647 --> 00:07:39.627
Huh?

74
00:07:40.317 --> 00:07:43.107
Is it true that there are spirits living in that forest?

75
00:07:43.717 --> 00:07:46.957
Oh, the mountain god's forest... Who knows.

76
00:07:46.957 --> 00:07:48.787
That's what they say.

77
00:07:53.947 --> 00:07:58.847
When I was little, I wanted to meet the spirits, so my friends and I often went into the forest.

78
00:07:59.357 --> 00:08:05.357
In the end, I never met any, but I had the feeling I'd occasionally spot something from the corner of my eye.

79
00:08:06.747 --> 00:08:11.417
On summer nights, you could hear the sounds of the river coming from the forest.

80
00:08:11.417 --> 00:08:18.027
And now that I think about it, Iwa said she and her friends went and had fun at a summer festival in the forest.

81
00:08:18.667 --> 00:08:22.837
But there's no way the villagers would've held a festival in the forest.

82
00:08:23.277 --> 00:08:25.957
So then, whose festival could it have been?

83
00:08:26.707 --> 00:08:32.497
It started this crazy story that they must've snuck into a festival for the spirits.

84
00:08:35.227 --> 00:08:38.227
Man, that takes me back!

85
00:08:38.227 --> 00:08:41.507
We were so stupid back when we were kids.

86
00:09:12.277 --> 00:09:15.067
<i>This is the forest where the mountain god and spirits live.</i>

87
00:09:16.437 --> 00:09:18.537
<i>Set foot within, and you'll lose your way and be lost forever.</i>

88
00:09:42.687 --> 00:09:43.567
You came.

89
00:09:46.117 --> 00:09:48.387
I didn't think you'd really come back.

90
00:09:49.497 --> 00:09:50.257
You...

91
00:09:52.517 --> 00:09:54.577
You waited for me!

92
00:09:59.337 --> 00:10:01.477
You just don't learn, do you?

93
00:10:02.187 --> 00:10:04.217
I was so happy, I just...

94
00:10:04.217 --> 00:10:05.397
Sorry.

95
00:10:07.727 --> 00:10:08.797
It's a bit hot here.

96
00:10:09.637 --> 00:10:11.097
Shall we go somewhere cooler?

97
00:10:11.457 --> 00:10:12.087
What?

98
00:10:12.997 --> 00:10:14.187
Don't worry.

99
00:10:14.647 --> 00:10:16.097
I'll see you out of here again.

100
00:11:11.677 --> 00:11:12.477
Gin.

101
00:11:13.377 --> 00:11:16.737
Is that a human child?

102
00:11:18.207 --> 00:11:20.247
Can I eat it?

103
00:11:22.127 --> 00:11:22.957
No.

104
00:11:23.877 --> 00:11:24.747
She's my friend.

105
00:11:25.237 --> 00:11:26.607
Is that so?

106
00:11:27.247 --> 00:11:28.637
Human child.

107
00:11:29.157 --> 00:11:32.027
Please don't touch Gin's skin.

108
00:11:33.107 --> 00:11:38.267
If you do, I'll eat you!

109
00:11:43.657 --> 00:11:45.537
Oh! Is that a fox?

110
00:11:49.407 --> 00:11:50.527
He's another one of the spirits.

111
00:11:52.087 --> 00:11:55.457
He transforms to scare people, but he's all bark and no bite.

112
00:11:59.217 --> 00:12:01.007
Amazing!

113
00:12:01.007 --> 00:12:04.037
This is the first time I've seen a real spirit!

114
00:12:04.037 --> 00:12:05.467
So they really do exist!

115
00:12:05.467 --> 00:12:09.027
Amazing! Incredible! Fantastic!

116
00:12:05.467 --> 00:12:09.027
So what did you think I was?

117
00:12:13.567 --> 00:12:15.547
Gin, are you a No-Face or something?

118
00:12:16.317 --> 00:12:18.287
Why do you wear a mask?

119
00:12:18.287 --> 00:12:19.757
No particular reason.

120
00:12:21.747 --> 00:12:22.857
Never mind me.

121
00:12:23.357 --> 00:12:24.807
Tell me about yourself.

122
00:12:26.837 --> 00:12:27.807
Are you curious?

123
00:12:29.407 --> 00:12:30.817
That's why I waited for you.

124
00:12:38.697 --> 00:12:43.707
<i>The next day and the day after that, I went back to the forest.</i>

125
00:12:45.537 --> 00:12:50.077
<i>Those summer days, I ran and played all around the mountain.</i>

126
00:12:53.877 --> 00:12:55.427
Over here, over here!

127
00:12:56.657 --> 00:12:58.497
It's better over there.

128
00:13:01.427 --> 00:13:02.347
There.

129
00:13:03.497 --> 00:13:04.337
Thank you!

130
00:13:13.747 --> 00:13:15.387
<i>Even though it was silly,</i>

131
00:13:16.307 --> 00:13:18.117
<i>it was so much fun.</i>

132
00:13:42.117 --> 00:13:45.137
Did Gin fall asleep?

133
00:13:53.067 --> 00:13:56.317
<i>It's fine if I touch his mask, right?</i>

134
00:14:13.327 --> 00:14:15.607
Ah, sorry!

135
00:14:15.607 --> 00:14:17.007
Ouch!

136
00:14:18.017 --> 00:14:22.127
Attacking someone while they're asleep... You sure are a scary little lady.

137
00:14:22.127 --> 00:14:24.507
I'm sorry, but

138
00:14:25.197 --> 00:14:27.307
you were pretending to sleep, weren't you?

139
00:14:29.797 --> 00:14:31.097
I looked normal, didn't I?

140
00:14:33.717 --> 00:14:35.577
Why are you wearing that mask?

141
00:14:36.577 --> 00:14:38.397
If I don't wear this mask,

142
00:14:39.087 --> 00:14:40.797
I don't look like a spirit, do I?

143
00:14:52.637 --> 00:14:53.887
You're weird.

144
00:15:02.297 --> 00:15:03.677
Um, Gin.

145
00:15:05.127 --> 00:15:07.287
I won't be able

146
00:15:08.067 --> 00:15:09.967
to come here tomorrow.

147
00:15:11.067 --> 00:15:12.887
I told you about it before, right?

148
00:15:13.327 --> 00:15:16.527
That I'm just staying at my uncle's place for the summer?

149
00:15:17.177 --> 00:15:20.767
So I have to go home tomorrow.

150
00:15:27.007 --> 00:15:28.447
Will you be able to come again next year?

151
00:15:32.617 --> 00:15:33.457
Yeah!

152
00:15:36.927 --> 00:15:38.447
<i>This is how summer</i>

153
00:15:39.627 --> 00:15:42.427
<i>became something I looked forward to.</i>

154
00:15:52.987 --> 00:15:57.477
<i>Gin waited for our promised summer.</i>

155
00:15:59.057 --> 00:16:00.827
It's cold!

156
00:16:02.717 --> 00:16:04.247
You're weird.

157
00:16:04.627 --> 00:16:06.527
Of course the water is cold.

158
00:16:19.277 --> 00:16:19.797
Gin!

159
00:16:21.487 --> 00:16:22.127
Gin!

160
00:16:22.967 --> 00:16:24.817
It's dangerous, Gin.

161
00:16:24.817 --> 00:16:27.097
That's a human child.

162
00:16:27.097 --> 00:16:30.967
If she touches you, you'll disappear.

163
00:16:30.967 --> 00:16:31.967
Thank you.

164
00:16:33.137 --> 00:16:34.227
I'm fine.

165
00:16:41.457 --> 00:16:45.117
Please don't touch him, human child.

166
00:16:46.737 --> 00:16:47.377
Yes.

167
00:16:56.787 --> 00:16:57.737
Gin.

168
00:16:59.077 --> 00:17:00.167
Be careful.

169
00:17:04.097 --> 00:17:08.437
The spirits can touch him, right?

170
00:17:10.237 --> 00:17:13.677
<i>Two summers passed. Then three. </i><i></i>

171
00:17:15.157 --> 00:17:16.127
Hotaru!

172
00:17:18.667 --> 00:17:19.537
Where are you?

173
00:17:22.347 --> 00:17:23.227
Hotaru.

174
00:17:24.057 --> 00:17:24.567
Hota—

175
00:17:28.687 --> 00:17:30.657
What're you doing?

176
00:17:33.107 --> 00:17:36.707
I wanted to see your startled face, but...

177
00:17:42.707 --> 00:17:44.227
At least when I'm around,

178
00:17:44.747 --> 00:17:47.367
can you take off your mask every once in a while?

179
00:17:48.377 --> 00:17:49.217
That's fine,

180
00:17:49.877 --> 00:17:51.467
but is there a reason?

181
00:17:52.057 --> 00:17:54.567
Not really, but—

182
00:17:56.797 --> 00:17:57.477
Watch out, Hota—

183
00:18:10.037 --> 00:18:11.317
That was close.

184
00:18:14.027 --> 00:18:15.497
Yeah...

185
00:18:17.597 --> 00:18:18.977
I'm sorry, Hotaru.

186
00:18:19.797 --> 00:18:20.807
Are you okay?

187
00:18:25.447 --> 00:18:26.787
Thank goodness.

188
00:18:28.737 --> 00:18:29.777
Hey, Gin.

189
00:18:34.107 --> 00:18:39.517
No matter what, don't ever touch me, okay?

190
00:18:44.937 --> 00:18:45.607
Okay?

191
00:18:55.917 --> 00:18:57.177
No matter what!

192
00:19:05.397 --> 00:19:09.007
<i>The next summer and the summer after that</i>

193
00:19:09.957 --> 00:19:12.287
<i>I visited the forest.</i>

194
00:19:21.887 --> 00:19:23.607
I'm leaving!

195
00:19:26.317 --> 00:19:28.517
Gin! I'm here again this year.

196
00:19:29.917 --> 00:19:30.897
Ta-da!

197
00:19:31.587 --> 00:19:33.547
I've become a fifth grader.

198
00:19:36.517 --> 00:19:37.257
Somehow,

199
00:19:38.087 --> 00:19:39.827
you're starting to look like a woman.

200
00:19:40.147 --> 00:19:42.327
I <i>am</i> a woman.

201
00:19:43.497 --> 00:19:44.367
Shall we go?

202
00:19:46.597 --> 00:19:47.357
Yeah.

203
00:19:47.357 --> 00:19:48.047
<i>Huh?</i>

204
00:19:48.597 --> 00:19:49.587
<i>This is...</i>

205
00:19:56.347 --> 00:19:57.437
Oh.

206
00:19:58.207 --> 00:19:58.837
Huh?

207
00:19:59.447 --> 00:20:00.267
Nothing.

208
00:20:01.057 --> 00:20:02.707
Even though I'm in middle school now,

209
00:20:02.707 --> 00:20:07.827
a lot of my elementary school friends are in the same classes, so it doesn't really feel like anything changed.

210
00:20:07.827 --> 00:20:11.587
<i>Our ages are gradually getting closer.</i>

211
00:20:08.367 --> 00:20:10.437
But rather than that...

212
00:20:17.807 --> 00:20:18.667
<i>Somehow,</i>

213
00:20:19.297 --> 00:20:23.617
<i>Gin ages much more slowly than humans.</i>

214
00:20:30.437 --> 00:20:31.177
Like this?

215
00:20:32.117 --> 00:20:35.467
Yeah, yeah. When I start running, let go, okay?

216
00:20:37.867 --> 00:20:39.397
Here I go!

217
00:21:13.807 --> 00:21:19.017
<i>As the years go by, my appearance changes,</i>

218
00:21:20.487 --> 00:21:24.267
<i>but Gin is almost the same as the day we met.</i>

219
00:22:02.337 --> 00:22:06.427
<i>Someday I'll be older than Gin, won't I?</i>

220
00:22:37.067 --> 00:22:38.427
Oh, Hotaru.

221
00:22:38.427 --> 00:22:40.337
I cut some watermelon. Let's eat.

222
00:22:40.607 --> 00:22:42.897
Okay. Yay!

223
00:22:48.597 --> 00:22:49.607
Where's Mom?

224
00:22:50.177 --> 00:22:51.527
Out shopping with your aunt.

225
00:22:51.897 --> 00:22:54.467
They went to buy gifts for friends in Yokohama.

226
00:22:56.767 --> 00:22:59.417
What time are you taking the bullet train tomorrow?

227
00:23:00.457 --> 00:23:01.527
I don't know,

228
00:23:01.527 --> 00:23:04.267
but they said I'll still be here until the afternoon.

229
00:23:05.367 --> 00:23:06.347
Is that so?

230
00:23:09.187 --> 00:23:11.997
This summer's weather was good, so the watermelons are sweet.

231
00:23:14.217 --> 00:23:17.407
If it continues like this, then winter will be freezing.

232
00:23:18.477 --> 00:23:19.757
Is it like that?

233
00:23:20.687 --> 00:23:21.707
It's like that.

234
00:23:24.577 --> 00:23:28.997
Since this area's located between mountains and the ocean's far away,

235
00:23:28.997 --> 00:23:31.917
the temperature difference between summer and winter is huge.

236
00:23:32.617 --> 00:23:36.007
The cold of a winter that follows an especially hot summer

237
00:23:36.387 --> 00:23:40.287
could probably freeze the mountain god himself.

238
00:23:47.447 --> 00:23:48.787
Um, Uncle...

239
00:23:52.777 --> 00:23:53.787
A scarf?

240
00:23:54.367 --> 00:23:55.027
Yep!

241
00:23:55.537 --> 00:23:57.047
Please use it in the winter, okay?

242
00:23:59.667 --> 00:24:00.507
Bye!

243
00:24:03.177 --> 00:24:03.907
Okay.

244
00:24:06.457 --> 00:24:07.957
See you next year!

245
00:24:23.867 --> 00:24:24.767
Takegawa?

246
00:24:25.397 --> 00:24:27.757
Shouldn't you be heading to your next class soon?

247
00:24:28.387 --> 00:24:30.077
Ah, you're right!

248
00:24:30.077 --> 00:24:31.667
Everyone left already.

249
00:24:31.667 --> 00:24:33.217
I'll see you later.

250
00:24:33.217 --> 00:24:34.947
Okay! Thanks.

251
00:24:56.857 --> 00:24:57.867
Thank you for the food.

252
00:24:57.867 --> 00:24:58.437
What?

253
00:24:58.837 --> 00:25:00.187
You're done?

254
00:25:00.427 --> 00:25:03.657
Ah, you probably ate before dinner, didn't you?

255
00:25:03.657 --> 00:25:05.407
If you snack, you'll gain weight.

256
00:25:05.407 --> 00:25:07.027
I didn't eat anything!

257
00:25:07.027 --> 00:25:08.897
Jeez. I'm gonna take a bath!

258
00:25:39.357 --> 00:25:40.217
Takegawa.

259
00:25:42.037 --> 00:25:43.357
Ta-ke-ga-wa.

260
00:25:44.757 --> 00:25:46.497
Oh, good morning.

261
00:25:46.797 --> 00:25:47.537
Good morning.

262
00:25:47.887 --> 00:25:50.527
There, near your feet. It's frozen.

263
00:25:55.967 --> 00:25:57.437
You'll slip. It's dangerous.

264
00:26:02.127 --> 00:26:03.037
Thank you.

265
00:26:10.387 --> 00:26:12.127
It's cold today.

266
00:26:13.957 --> 00:26:17.817
Haven't you been a little out of it lately?

267
00:26:18.277 --> 00:26:21.337
Actually, you've always been that way, but...

268
00:26:23.057 --> 00:26:24.037
<i>I want to</i>

269
00:26:26.197 --> 00:26:27.397
<i>see Gin.</i>

270
00:26:52.937 --> 00:26:53.837
<i>I want to</i>

271
00:26:57.177 --> 00:26:58.337
<i>touch Gin.</i>

272
00:27:26.897 --> 00:27:28.587
Is that your new uniform?

273
00:27:29.027 --> 00:27:29.757
Yeah.

274
00:27:39.527 --> 00:27:41.017
Time really flies, doesn't it?

275
00:27:41.627 --> 00:27:43.497
You're already in high school, huh.

276
00:27:43.497 --> 00:27:44.477
Yup.

277
00:27:54.187 --> 00:27:56.617
You don't come running at me anymore these days.

278
00:27:56.617 --> 00:28:00.887
I learned my lesson after all those beatings.

279
00:28:08.597 --> 00:28:09.937
I'm looking forward to it.

280
00:28:10.867 --> 00:28:15.647
In three years, when I graduate, I plan on looking for a job here.

281
00:28:16.547 --> 00:28:19.717
Then I can be with you more.

282
00:28:21.227 --> 00:28:22.057
In autumn,

283
00:28:23.117 --> 00:28:23.967
winter,

284
00:28:25.167 --> 00:28:26.087
spring...

285
00:28:27.177 --> 00:28:28.167
Always.

286
00:28:29.047 --> 00:28:29.667
Right?

287
00:28:35.647 --> 00:28:36.447
Hotaru.

288
00:28:38.047 --> 00:28:40.897
Let me tell you about myself.

289
00:28:42.847 --> 00:28:44.437
I'm not a spirit.

290
00:28:45.457 --> 00:28:46.257
But,

291
00:28:47.517 --> 00:28:48.997
I'm no longer human.

292
00:28:50.227 --> 00:28:52.177
It seems like I was once a human,

293
00:28:52.177 --> 00:28:53.797
but when I was a baby,

294
00:28:53.797 --> 00:28:55.737
I was abandoned in this forest.

295
00:28:56.907 --> 00:29:01.807
I'd only just been abandoned, so I cried helplessly

296
00:29:03.057 --> 00:29:06.447
as if to call back the parents who left me.

297
00:29:08.877 --> 00:29:10.687
They say I didn't stop crying for a long time.

298
00:29:17.847 --> 00:29:21.997
I should've died then,

299
00:29:22.447 --> 00:29:26.767
but the mountain god appeared and cast a spell that allowed me to continue living.

300
00:29:28.007 --> 00:29:32.317
So that I never move on.

301
00:29:35.887 --> 00:29:37.747
I'm like a ghost.

302
00:29:40.517 --> 00:29:41.307
Hotaru.

303
00:29:42.427 --> 00:29:44.147
It's okay if you forget about me.

304
00:29:47.897 --> 00:29:51.127
A body that's maintained by magic is very weak.

305
00:29:52.347 --> 00:29:54.387
If it touches a real human body,

306
00:29:54.807 --> 00:29:56.747
the spell will break and the body will disappear.

307
00:29:56.747 --> 00:29:58.717
It's such a fragile thing.

308
00:29:58.717 --> 00:29:59.687
How long can you—

309
00:29:59.687 --> 00:30:01.687
Something that disappears when touched...

310
00:30:02.387 --> 00:30:03.997
It's just like snow, isn't it?

311
00:30:05.107 --> 00:30:06.737
Gin,

312
00:30:07.867 --> 00:30:11.197
I thought of you during winter.

313
00:30:12.247 --> 00:30:13.097
Even during autumn

314
00:30:14.207 --> 00:30:15.197
and spring.

315
00:30:16.617 --> 00:30:17.357
Gin,

316
00:30:18.217 --> 00:30:20.507
don't forget about me.

317
00:30:21.977 --> 00:30:23.167
Don't forget.

318
00:30:25.927 --> 00:30:30.077
Time might separate us some day.

319
00:30:31.037 --> 00:30:31.517
But,

320
00:30:32.577 --> 00:30:33.517
even still,

321
00:30:34.157 --> 00:30:35.527
until then,

322
00:30:36.397 --> 00:30:37.827
let's stay together.

323
00:30:42.847 --> 00:30:44.537
Spirit festival?

324
00:30:44.687 --> 00:30:47.857
No, a summer festival held by the spirits.

325
00:30:48.087 --> 00:30:49.527
There's not much of a difference.

326
00:30:49.527 --> 00:30:51.537
The nuance is completely different!

327
00:30:52.067 --> 00:30:53.227
Nuance?

328
00:30:54.147 --> 00:30:58.047
When you were little, I thought you might get scared, so I didn't invite you.

329
00:30:58.797 --> 00:31:02.037
But tonight, can you sneak out of your house?

330
00:31:02.587 --> 00:31:04.857
I've wanted to go with you for a long time.

331
00:31:06.977 --> 00:31:08.927
I-I want to go!

332
00:31:08.927 --> 00:31:11.717
Meet me at eight at our usual place.

333
00:31:12.217 --> 00:31:16.857
But a festival filled with spirits sounds a little unnerving...

334
00:31:17.267 --> 00:31:18.907
On top of that, it's at night.

335
00:31:19.837 --> 00:31:20.747
Don't worry.

336
00:31:21.207 --> 00:31:23.337
On the outside, it's not very different from a human festival.

337
00:31:23.937 --> 00:31:26.577
It's supposed to mimic human festivals, after all.

338
00:31:27.287 --> 00:31:29.767
And I'll protect you, Hotaru.

339
00:31:30.837 --> 00:31:35.037
When you say things that, it makes me want to glomp you.

340
00:31:35.037 --> 00:31:35.997
Do it.

341
00:31:37.357 --> 00:31:38.307
Seriously.

342
00:31:55.517 --> 00:31:57.357
Wait! Wait!

343
00:32:17.747 --> 00:32:21.377
It's true. It's just like a human festival.

344
00:32:21.967 --> 00:32:23.767
Are they all disguised as humans?

345
00:32:23.767 --> 00:32:25.907
That's right. Impressive, isn't it?

346
00:32:25.907 --> 00:32:29.527
I've heard that sometimes even humans unknowingly mix in.

347
00:32:31.047 --> 00:32:32.897
Like Iwa and her friends, huh?

348
00:32:32.897 --> 00:32:33.707
Who?

349
00:32:37.847 --> 00:32:38.687
Hotaru.

350
00:32:40.127 --> 00:32:42.057
Tie this around your wrist.

351
00:32:42.527 --> 00:32:43.477
You'll get lost.

352
00:32:48.517 --> 00:32:50.427
It's just like going on a date!

353
00:32:51.277 --> 00:32:53.027
This <i>is</i> a date.

354
00:32:55.857 --> 00:32:56.757
Shall we go?

355
00:32:57.317 --> 00:32:57.867
Yeah.

356
00:33:25.357 --> 00:33:26.237
Here you go.

357
00:33:46.247 --> 00:33:47.427
Weird.

358
00:34:00.087 --> 00:34:01.817
Ew, a couple!

359
00:34:01.817 --> 00:34:03.217
Hey!

360
00:34:15.067 --> 00:34:17.437
Look! That kid has a tail!

361
00:34:34.487 --> 00:34:36.427
I-I'm sorry!

362
00:34:53.947 --> 00:34:56.867
Wow, that was so weird!

363
00:34:56.867 --> 00:34:59.177
Everyone went all out with their disguises, didn't they?

364
00:34:59.177 --> 00:35:01.257
It was like a mimicking competition!

365
00:35:01.257 --> 00:35:02.677
Is it like this every year?

366
00:35:02.997 --> 00:35:07.347
Yeah, every time summer comes around...

367
00:35:09.607 --> 00:35:10.447
Hotaru,

368
00:35:11.167 --> 00:35:14.597
I can no longer wait for summer to come around.

369
00:35:16.197 --> 00:35:21.597
When I'm away from you, even though I can't be around crowds, I want to go see you.

370
00:35:46.787 --> 00:35:47.707
That mask...

371
00:35:48.617 --> 00:35:49.407
Have it.

372
00:35:56.117 --> 00:36:02.647
<i>He probably won't come to that place next summer.</i>

373
00:36:05.077 --> 00:36:08.397
<i>This is definitely our last...</i>

374
00:36:08.687 --> 00:36:10.077
Wait!

375
00:36:11.287 --> 00:36:11.897
Watch out!

376
00:36:14.527 --> 00:36:15.657
Are you okay?

377
00:36:15.837 --> 00:36:17.627
Yeah. Thank you!

378
00:36:18.297 --> 00:36:19.757
Be careful, okay?

379
00:36:29.447 --> 00:36:30.297
Gin?

380
00:36:33.337 --> 00:36:34.757
Was that boy a human?

381
00:36:41.417 --> 00:36:42.227
Gin!

382
00:36:43.127 --> 00:36:44.667
Come here, Hotaru!

383
00:36:45.267 --> 00:36:47.117
I can finally touch you.

384
00:37:28.047 --> 00:37:29.027
I love you.

385
00:37:29.777 --> 00:37:30.477
Yeah.

386
00:37:31.647 --> 00:37:32.957
I love you, too.

387
00:37:55.407 --> 00:37:56.617
<i>Deep green.</i>

388
00:37:57.907 --> 00:37:59.687
<i>This is the mountain god's forest.</i>

389
00:38:04.147 --> 00:38:06.837
Hotaru. Thank you.

390
00:38:07.217 --> 00:38:11.077
We wanted to be with Gin forever, but...

391
00:38:11.077 --> 00:38:16.317
Gin wanted to touch a human.

392
00:38:16.737 --> 00:38:20.727
He finally got to be hugged by a human.

393
00:38:21.577 --> 00:38:23.897
<i>I probably won't be able to</i>

394
00:38:26.247 --> 00:38:28.827
<i>look forward to summer for a long time.</i>

395
00:38:29.687 --> 00:38:30.987
<i>My chest will hurt.</i>

396
00:38:31.747 --> 00:38:33.237
<i>My tears will be overflowing.</i>

397
00:38:34.487 --> 00:38:42.987
<i>But this warmth in my hands and these summer memories will live on in my heart.</i>

398
00:38:50.657 --> 00:38:52.447
<i>So, let's go.</i>

399
00:38:57.337 --> 00:38:58.507
<i>Let us go.</i>

400
00:39:31.157 --> 00:39:31.167


401
00:39:37.607 --> 00:44:26.927
m 1920 960 l 1920 1080 l 0 1080 l 0 960 l 1920 960

402
00:39:57.457 --> 00:40:03.387
The cicadas laugh out in song

403
00:40:04.287 --> 00:40:10.027
to the red evening sunset

404
00:40:10.447 --> 00:40:17.267
The way back home is long

405
00:40:18.127 --> 00:40:24.417
but I promised to come here again tomorrow

406
00:40:28.167 --> 00:40:40.447
The summer is in full bloom

407
00:40:41.747 --> 00:40:54.587
making you look more beautiful than ever

408
00:41:09.487 --> 00:41:15.757
I thought the tale would never end

409
00:41:16.777 --> 00:41:22.557
but I realize now that something comes after

410
00:41:23.277 --> 00:41:30.107
The crows too took flight

411
00:41:31.047 --> 00:41:38.057
and went somewhere far, far away

412
00:41:41.737 --> 00:41:54.277
The summer flies by

413
00:41:55.847 --> 00:42:08.747
to hide away its treasures till next year

414
00:42:56.657 --> 00:43:03.097
I'll never ever forget

415
00:43:04.377 --> 00:43:10.577
those golden summer days

416
00:43:11.247 --> 00:43:18.127
That summer which brought joy

417
00:43:19.417 --> 00:43:25.707
to my boring everyday life

418
00:43:31.397 --> 00:43:44.497
And look! Summer is here again

419
00:43:45.317 --> 00:43:57.607
to help me keep my promise of that day

420
00:43:58.827 --> 00:44:11.587
The summer is still in bloom

421
00:44:12.597 --> 00:44:25.417
making you look more beautiful than ever
